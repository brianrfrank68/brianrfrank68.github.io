                         2023 Pitcher Durability
                         -----------------------

Pitcher durability ratings determine how many pitches can be thrown
before a pitcher begins to lose effectiveness.  These limits apply over
a moving five-day window.  Because there's a big difference between
throwing 35 pitches yesterday and throwing 35 pitches three days ago,
separate limits apply to each portion of that window:  just today,
today plus yesterday, today plus the last two days, and so on.

Pitcher usage patterns have changed over time so the limits can differ
for the same durability rating based upon the era of play in which a
league is set.  The tables below show the one-game and five-game limits
for the 2023 AL and 2023 NL eras and may help you decide when to remove
a pitcher, but it's important to keep in mind that there are two-game,
three-game, and four-game limits, too.

In addition, pitcher endurance can be affected by the weather.  If it's
very hot, very cold, or raining, pitchers can begin to tire sooner than
usual.  These tables give the limits for games played in ideal baseball
weather.
